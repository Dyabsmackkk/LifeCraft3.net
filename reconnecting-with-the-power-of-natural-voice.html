<header><h2>Reconnecting With The Power of Natural Voice</h2></header>
<p>I want to reconnect with the power of my natural, authentic voice.</p>
Freeing my natural voice is a path that leads to reconnecting with my authentic self, which is what I've been trying to do for more than two decades living in the united states.</p>

<p>I have tried cognitive behavioral therapy, overcoming social anxiety, taking voice lessons, singing lessons, advanced public speaking, communication and acting, dating and pickiup, meetups, festivals, social clubs. None of these activities got me the result and fulfillment I was seeking.</p>

<p>After being on a radical journey of spiritual transformation over the past three years I realised that I've been trying to do this whole time is to be myself. I've been trying to reconnenct with a sense of self that I've lost since I move to the United States.

<p>Now that I'm experimenting with opening up of my natural voice and my authentic style of speaking. I'm starting to reconnect with that true essence that I've lost and have been searching for all these years.</p>

<p>I have Accumilated great wisdom from the journey of spritual healing and transformation on how to reconnect with my natural voice in a gradual, gentle and loving way, and I believe sharing insights on how to do that will be of great value to other people.</p>

<p>When we are truly i touch with the power of our voice, speaking becomes joy and medicine. Anything you talk about can be joy for you and medicine for other people. This is what I'm currently striving to accomplish by working on my own voice.</p>

<p>By making YouTube videos I'll be able to document my own process of reconnecting with my natural voice and authentic self because I'm still in the process of regaining my voice.</p>

<p>As I become comfortable with my own voice, I'm hoping to connect with people beyond words, I'm hoping to express myself with the kind of energy that will speak to the people on a soul level. I want to embody truth, love and beauty of creation and speak with the energy that will communicate all these values that I want to embody and share.</p>
